## Results

 From the data analysis dashboard, we were able to gather some insights on the net profit made by network, the months with the highest data sales and the site users visited more often. The analysis also reviews that Corporate brings more of the profit to the network, and most of the employees are of the middle age class. 
 ## Recommendations

 The network should captalize on the months with the highest data sales and implement similar strategies throughout the year through marketing. The network should collaborate with Google to specialized data plans for users like students using it for assignments and reserach project and also for consumers to encourage more data purchases.
